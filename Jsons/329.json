    "description": "My emotions come and go like the tide some days, they crash, others they gently roll in. Living with a disability means feeling things more intensely, riding waves of joy, sadness, fear, and love. But I've learned that no matter the tide, I can survive it, grow from it, and find my way back to calm.",
