    "description": "There's a certain strength in being the outsider, in standing apart from the crowd and seeing the world differently. My heart beats with the knowledge that being an outsider isn't a weakness it's a perspective that gives me a deeper understanding of life. The heart of the outsider is full of resilience, compassion, and a love for the world that's often overlooked.",
