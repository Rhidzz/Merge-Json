    "description": "Sometimes, I feel caught in a dream, where everything feels surreal and out of my control. The world around me isn't always kind to those of us who are differently-abled, but in this dream, I find moments of clarity and peace. Caught in a dream, I learn to embrace who I am, even when it doesn't feel like reality.",
