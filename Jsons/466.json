    "description": "Vulnerability is where I've found grace, a soft strength that flows from within. It's in allowing myself to be open that I discover the depth of my own power. The grace in being vulnerable is a reminder that I don't need to hide parts of myself to be strong; it's in my authenticity that I find my greatest strength.",
