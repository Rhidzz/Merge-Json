    "description": "Sometimes, I feel lost in my own reflection, unsure of how I fit into the world or how the world sees me. My image doesn't always match the way I feel inside, and it can be hard to reconcile the two. But even when I'm lost in my reflection, I know that I'm constantly evolving, constantly finding pieces of myself I never knew existed.",
