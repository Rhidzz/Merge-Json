    "description": "There's a chaos inside me that no one sees, a constant swirl of thoughts, emotions, and dreams. Living with a disability means that the world often feels like too much to handle, but it's in the chaos that I find clarity. Inside the chaos, I learn to navigate the noise and discover my true self.",
