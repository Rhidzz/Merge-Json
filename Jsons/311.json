    "description": "My mind is restless, constantly searching for answers, solutions, and a sense of peace. Living with a disability means thinking about things that others might never have to, trying to navigate a world that wasn't built for me. A restless mind isn't a curse it's a reminder that I'm always striving to grow, to find my way, to be more than what others expect.",
