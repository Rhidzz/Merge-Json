    "description": "My emotions sometimes haunt me, staying in the shadows of my mind, tugging at me even when I try to push them away. Being differently-abled means feeling things more deeply, and these emotions can be overwhelming. But they also remind me that I'm alive, that I feel, and that I am capable of love, even when it feels like a haunting.",
