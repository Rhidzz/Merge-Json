    "description": "Some days, I feel like I'm fading in my own mind, lost in thoughts that feel too big to handle. Living with a disability means my mind doesn't always work the way others expect, and sometimes that leaves me feeling disconnected. But even when I feel like I'm fading, I know I'm still here, still fighting, still finding my way back.",
