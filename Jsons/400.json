    "description": "I've learned that beauty isn't always what the world expects to see it's found in the strength I carry, the journey I walk, and the unique way I experience the world. My beauty doesn't fit into the typical mold, but it's no less real. A different kind of beauty is the one that doesn't seek validation it simply exists.",
