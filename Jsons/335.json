    "description": "My heart often feels like a cage, holding onto emotions and desires that I can't always express. Being differently-abled means trying to make sense of a world that isn't always kind to me, and sometimes, it feels like I'm trapped within my own feelings. But even in this place, I know my heart is strong, capable of love and resilience.",
