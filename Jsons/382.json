    "description": "My heart is vulnerable open to the world, to love, to pain, and everything in between. Living with a disability has taught me that vulnerability isn't weakness; it's a source of power. A vulnerable heart is one that feels everything deeply, and in that depth, I find the courage to face whatever comes next.",
