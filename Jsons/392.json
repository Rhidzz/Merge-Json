    "description": "I live in the shadow of difference where my struggles aren't always visible to the outside world, but they shape everything I do. Living this way means constantly finding my own space, my own path, in a world that's not made for me. But in the shadow of difference, I've learned that there is strength, beauty, and power in being myself.",
