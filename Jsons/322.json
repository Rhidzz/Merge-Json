    "description": "There are moments when it feels like I'm struggling to breathe, like the weight of everything I'm facing is too heavy to carry. But even in those moments, I remind myself that I've made it this far, that I've survived more than I thought possible. Struggling to breathe doesn't mean I'm failing it means I'm alive, fighting for my place in this world.",
