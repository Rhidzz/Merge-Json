    "description": "Beneath all my thoughts lies a truth that only I know, a place where my heart and mind try to find peace. Being differently-abled means that my thoughts are always moving, always shifting, but beneath it all, I find a sense of calm that comes from simply existing. Beneath my thoughts, I find the quiet strength that keeps me moving.",
