    "description": "Through every challenge, I'm mindful of you of how we share this journey, of how your love and support keep me going. Living with a disability means that I don't always have all the answers, but with you by my side, I feel stronger. Being mindful of you reminds me that love is the light in the midst of the darkness.",
