    "description": "I've learned that I don't have to follow the beat that others set for me. I thrive when I follow my own rhythm, moving at my own pace, and trusting that my journey is just as important. Thriving in my own rhythm means embracing who I am and the pace that works for me, without trying to keep up with anyone else.",
