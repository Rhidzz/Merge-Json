    "description": "There's a stillness before the storm, a quiet that feels heavy with what's about to come. I can feel it building emotions, thoughts, changes that I can't quite predict. The quiet before the storm is a reminder that even in uncertainty, I have the power to brace myself for whatever comes next.",
