    "description": "My heart is open, wide and vulnerable, ready to welcome whatever life brings. It hasn't always been easy to open up, but I've learned that love, connection, and peace come when I allow myself to be fully open. A heart open to the world is a heart that believes in the goodness of what's to come.",
