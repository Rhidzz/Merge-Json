    "description": "Sometimes, I feel like I'm wandering through you, trying to understand the spaces where our worlds meet. Living with a disability means navigating a world that wasn't built for me, and I find myself learning from your love, your patience, and your understanding. Wandering through you, I find my strength, my connection, and the ability to keep moving forward.",
