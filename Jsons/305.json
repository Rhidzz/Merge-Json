    "description": "I see myself in cracked reflections fractured, imperfect, but still whole. Living with a disability means constantly rethinking how I see myself, how the world sees me, and how I feel about it all. These cracks aren't flaws they're reminders that I'm still standing, still strong, and still moving forward.",
