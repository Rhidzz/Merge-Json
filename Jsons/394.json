    "description": "There are times when I feel completely out of sync with the world, like I'm moving to a different beat. Everything feels a little off, like I don't quite fit, and yet, I've learned that it's okay to move at my own pace. Feeling out of sync isn't failure it's a reminder that I'm unique, that I have my own rhythm.",
