    "description": "There's peace in resting in my own skin, in being comfortable with who I am, no matter what the world thinks. I've spent too long trying to fit into spaces that weren't made for me, but now I've learned to honor myself just as I am. Resting in my own skin is freedom it's knowing that I am enough as I am.",
