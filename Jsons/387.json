    "description": "Sometimes, I feel unseen, like I don't exist in the way others do, like my struggles aren't as visible or understood. But I am here, always, learning to stand in my truth, even when no one else sees it. Unseen but here, I carry my own weight, my own strength, and I know my worth, even if others don't.",
