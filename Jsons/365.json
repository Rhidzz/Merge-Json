    "description": "There are nights when my thoughts seem to swirl in the dark, bringing up doubts, fears, and questions I don't always have answers for. But it's in the dark that I find clarity, where the quiet allows me to sort through the noise and discover what truly matters. Thoughts in the dark are a part of the process, a reminder that growth often comes from the places we least expect.",
