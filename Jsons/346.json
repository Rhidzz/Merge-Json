    "description": "My heart speaks in whispers quiet, gentle, but full of emotion. Living with a disability means my heart sometimes feels too loud for the world to hear, but it still beats with love, with hope, and with courage. A whispered heart is one that feels everything, but doesn't always need to shout to be heard.",
