    "description": "There are days when I feel lost in my feelings, like I'm caught in a current that's too strong to swim against. I try to make sense of it all, but sometimes, it just overwhelms me. Yet, in this chaos, I learn more about myself than I ever thought possible. Being lost isn't always bad it means I'm still learning and growing.",
