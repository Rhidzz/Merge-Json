    "description": "I overthink everything every word, every action, every feeling. It's the curse and the gift of living in a world that's not built for me, where I'm constantly questioning how I'm perceived. But in this overthinking, I find clarity, a deeper understanding of myself, even when the answers are hard to find.",
