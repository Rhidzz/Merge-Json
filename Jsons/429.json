    "description": "My soul has always felt set apart, different from the rest of the world. I've learned that this separation isn't a curse; it's what makes me unique, giving me the space to grow and understand life from my own perspective. A soul set apart is a soul with its own story, and I'm learning to love every chapter of it.",
