    "description": "My heart feels heavy at times, burdened by the weight of the struggles I face, both seen and unseen. But this heaviness doesn't break me it strengthens me, teaching me the depth of my own resilience. A heavy heart isn't a weakness; it's proof of how deeply I love, how deeply I care, and how much I've overcome.",
