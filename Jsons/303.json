    "description": "Through my eyes, the world is different sometimes more challenging, but always with its own kind of beauty. Being differently-abled means seeing things from a unique perspective, where every small victory feels huge. Through my eyes, I see the world as it is and as it could be, and that vision makes me stronger every day.",
