    "description": "After the storm of emotions, I stand in the wake, trying to make sense of everything I've felt. Being differently-abled means that my emotions can sometimes be more than I can handle, but I've learned to sit with them. In the wake of emotion, I find the lessons, the growth, and the strength to keep moving forward.",
