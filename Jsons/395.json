    "description": "I am constantly unraveling the layers of who I am, peeling back the parts that no longer serve me, and learning to embrace what remains. It's not always easy, but each layer I uncover brings me closer to understanding myself. Unraveling the layers means growing, learning, and becoming more of who I'm meant to be.",
