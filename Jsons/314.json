    "description": "Empathy runs through me like a whisper, soft but powerful, making me feel connected to the world and its struggles. Living with a disability means feeling things more deeply, understanding the pain of others in ways most can't. These whispers of empathy remind me that my heart is open, that I am not alone in what I feel.",
