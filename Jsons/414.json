    "description": "I often walk alone, navigating a world that doesn't always make space for me, but I'm never truly alone. The people who see me for who I am, who walk with me in spirit, make this journey worthwhile. Walking alone, together is a reminder that even when the path is solitary, there's always connection, always support.",
