    "description": "Inside me, there's a storm that no one sees, a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions that sometimes feel too strong to handle. Living with a disability means navigating this internal chaos, learning to weather the storm and find calm in the eye of it. The storm may rage, but it doesn't control me; it shapes me, reminding me of my resilience.",
