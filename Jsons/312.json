    "description": "Sometimes, the tears come when no one is watching, in the silence where I can feel everything I'm carrying. Being differently-abled means feeling the weight of the world in a way others don't always see. These tears aren't weakness they're a release, a way to let go of the pain and keep moving forward.",
